# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented here.

## Upcoming

### Changes

- When a field in your request validation has a [`regex`](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/validation#rule-regex) rule. It gets a `format` rule within the Swagger config.
- When a route-parameter has a [`where`](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing#parameters-regular-expression-constraints) (or `format` in Swagger terms) it now adds this in the Swagger config.
- Added support for [server templating](https://github.com/RicoNijeboer/laravel-to-swagger/issues/4).
- OAuth URLs are now relative when you don't supply a custom domain to them.
- When a route has a custom domain using `->domain(...)` it is now displayed in the Swagger config.

### Upgrading

- When updating to this version add an alter migration for the `swagger_batches` table which adds a nullable `route_domain` column   
  `$table->string('route_domain')->nullable();`

**Bugfixes**

- The configured connection was not being used within the added migrations.
    - To ensure your tables are created in the right connection add a `connection` call to the `Schema::create` in the migration.

## Changes since version 1

When version 1 would create a Swagger config, it generated it by reading all the registered Routes that match the filters (defined by the developers). This worked fine, except there were a few hacks I
had to do to not mess up any data sources you had in your database.

With version 2 this is a lot different; I don't execute your code based on the registered routes. You execute your code, and in the background I store just enough information to generate a Swagger
config (with responses now ðŸŽ‰). Because I want you to have safe data in your database, I completely obfuscate the json responses you are sending from your API. I have tried doing so and keeping the
same data formats, although I may have missed one.
(If you find one feel free to make a Pull Request or Issue, and I'll get to it).

With version 2 gone are all the filters that you had to define; You add the middleware and tag through the middleware. That's it.
